/**
 * Set Differentials technique:
 * 
 * TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Like finned-counts, this technique has fundamental logical flaws
 * that cause incorrect deductions. It needs to be redesigned to properly verify that
 * cells are actually FORCED by the logic, not just possible placements.
 * 
 * Identifies pairs of overlapping composite shapes where the difference
 * in their star counts forces specific cells in the symmetric difference.
 * 
 * For example, if shape A must have at least 3 stars and shape B (which
 * contains A) can have at most 4 stars, then the cells in B-A can have
 * at most 1 star.
 * 
 * This technique compares:
 * - Minimum star counts for smaller shapes
 * - Maximum star counts for larger shapes
 * - The symmetric difference between shapes
